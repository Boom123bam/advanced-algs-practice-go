# Lab 1: Divide and Conquer

This lab explores the Divide and Conquer paradigm through 6 exercises.
Each exercise should be solved using Divide and Conquer approach:

1. Divide the problem into smaller subproblems
2. Solve subproblems recursively (conquer)
3. Combine solutions to solve the original problem

## Exercises:

### Exercise 1: Sum Array
Implement `sumArray(arr []int) int` to calculate the sum of all elements in the array using Divide and Conquer.

### Exercise 2: Plus Minus
Implement `plusMinus(arr []int) int` to compute v1 - v2 + v3 - v4 + ... ± vn using Divide and Conquer.

### Exercise 3: Find Maximum
Implement `findMax(arr []int) int` to find the maximum element in an array using Divide and Conquer.

### Exercise 4: Find Max and Min
Implement `findMaxMin(arr []int) (int, int)` to find both maximum and minimum elements in an array using Divide and Conquer.

### Exercise 5: Count Value
Implement `countValue(arr []int, value int) int` to count occurrences of a specific value in an array using Divide and Conquer.

### Exercise 6: Maximum Subarray Sum
Implement `maxSubarraySum(arr []int) int` to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using Divide and Conquer.

Note: For maximum subarray sum, remember to consider:
1. Maximum sum entirely in left half
2. Maximum sum entirely in right half
3. Maximum sum crossing the midpoint
